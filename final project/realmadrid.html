                <b>Real Madrid</b>, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.
                Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn 
                a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for 
                "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the 
                royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-
                capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European 
                sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout 
                its history. Real Madrid is one of the most widely supported teams internationally.[6] 
                The club was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most 
                valuable football team.[7] In 2021, it was the second highest-earning football club in 
                the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.[8]
                Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from
                the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona),
                Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona
                and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major 
                force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five 
                consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This 
                success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league 
                titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc 
                Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be 
                the greatest of all time.[9][10][11]
                In domestic football, the club has won 68 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 19 Copa 
                del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[12] In 
                European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a record 14
                European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] 
                five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record seven 
                club world championships.[note 3]
                Real Madrid  was recognised as the FIFA Club of the 20th Century on 11 December 
                2000 with 42.35% of the vote,[18] and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 
                20 May 2004.[19] The club was also named Best European Club of the 20th Century by the 
                IFFHS on 11 May 2010. In June 2017, Madrid succeeded in becoming the first club to win 
                consecutive titles in the Champions League era. In May 2022, they won a record-extending 
                fourteenth European Cup, making it five titles in the last nine seasons. As of December 
                2022, Real Madrid are ranked sixth behind Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, 
                Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA club rankings.[20]
